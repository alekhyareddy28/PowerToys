    * Remove Autosuggest box (#2192)
    
    * Update Settings.Designer.cs
    
    * Revert "Update Settings.Designer.cs"
    
    This reverts commit a1bc0dda564733f079235ed48e33b6bde768b24f.
    
    * Updated LauncherControl XAML to add textbox and listview
    
    * List View displayed
    
    * Hooking up execution on the selected index, removing two way binding on selection, and experimenting with popup that doesn't work
    
    * Updated MainViewModel to Remove context menu and history
    
    * Added Resultist XAML Island project
    
    * Updated SelectedItem and SelectedList Binding.
    Issues :  List box doesn't open when query is written for first time but opens in subsequent queries.
    
    * 1. Mouse Click working
    2. List View is can't be focused
    3. Fixed width of Launcher
    
    * Removed two way QueryText box binding
    
    * Removed SelectedItem two way binding and replaced with a callback

    * Added the auto-complete feature
    
    * Removing ContextMenuPluginInfo, and ContextMenuTopMost as these commands are not used int the new design.
    
    * Fixed merge conflicts
    
    * Set only when index is 0
    
    * One way binding
    
    * Removed unnecessary binding
    
    * Deleting unused (commented out code) that was legacy from wox project.
    
    * Binding Buttons to appropriate context menu commands.
    1. Buttons are dynamically loaded in a listview based on the actions supported be each plugin.
    
    This change also deletes unused commands.
    
    Note:  Most button events don't seem to be getting routed to the Selected Item.  Currently using 'PointerEntered' to validate the behavior.  The actions should be trigged by the button command property in the future.
    
    * manually handling tab in mainwindow
    
    * Loading context buttons on Selecting a suggestion list item
    
    * Allowing hover event to load content menu items and display them as well.
    
    * Adding context buttons to Indexer plugin.  This allows for the following:
    1. [Files] Open Containing folder
    2. [Folders/Files] Copy Path

    * Renaming SelectedIndex to ContextMenuSelectedIndex
    
    * Enabling key accelerators on context buttons.
    1. Add new object ContextMenuResult instead instead of reusing Result for both query results and context menu results.
    2. Binding KeyboardAccelerator keys to contextmenuitemviewmodel
    3. Enabling and disabling contextmenu items when selecting or deselecting each row.  Because we are manually maintaining selectionwe can't use ScopeOwners as the textbox is really the only item ever in focus.
    
    * Launching explorer instead of the UWP application when selecting 'open file location'.
    
    * Added fix for border showing up when result count is zero

    ShortcutGuide, FancyZones: split window filtering (#1225)
    
    Splits the code use to filter windows for FancyZones and the
    "active window" for the ShortcutGuide. The FancyZones logic is preserved
    and merged into a single function. We keep it in common.h, as it might
    be also used in other PowerToys, like maximized to new desktop. We do
    however change the return type to be more descriptive. It also returns
    a separate flag for if the window has a visible owner. This can be used
    to implement the approved apps list.
    
    For the ShortcutGuide, the logic is relaxed to include more windows. One
    example are Explorer properties windows. Those are (and should) filtered
    by the FancyZones, but should appear in the window preview in the SCG.
    
    The new return type also includes information if the window will react
    to the default Windows Snap. This is not ideal though. Currently, SCG
    can only disable the entire "Windows Controls" group. OTOH windows like
    "Save As..." dialogs can be snapped to corners etc., but cannot be
    minimized nor maximized. Until SCG can separately disable those buttons
    we will display the buttons in the enabled state only if the window
    supports all settings. In the future, we should integrate FancyZones
    snap override here too.

    Common: remove hwnd_data_cache (#1223)
    
    The cache was introduced to improve performance by not querying the
    OS for the window process path every time we need to check if the window
    is interesting to FancyZones. Since then other changes were made to the
    the way we check the windows. Right now, the IsInterestingWindow function is
    called when:
    
      1) WinKey + arrows are used
      2) window is started to be dragged
      3) window is created
    
    1) and 2) are initiated by the user, happen only once per interaction so
    their performance impact can be dismissed. The 3) happens all the time
    but for the most part the check for WS_CHILD or
    GetAncestor(window, GA_ROOT) == window will filter those out. In the
    end, only top-level windows will be queried for their path.
    
    Removing the cache improves code readability and will make code
    maintenance easier.

    FancyZones: if window is not interesting, allow Windows snap (#1186)
    
    Do not swallow WinKey+Arrow events for non-interesting windows. This makes apps that are in the "excluded apps" list behave as if "Override windows snap keys" is disabled - they will react to the Windows default snap.

    Fix pinyin fuzzysearch (#131)
    
    * fix typo
    
    * make function obsolete
    
    it is not used in the code
    
    * rewrite the function that converts chinese chars to pinyin
    
    1. Only difference in this rewrite is instead of returning 2D array, return as a combined single string of all the possible pinyin combination. Since fuzzy search does character matching, this shouldn't be a problem.
    
    2. Added a function that returns a custom language converter. In this case Pinyin converter. New converters can be added.
    
    * Use new language converter param + strip out ScoreForPinyin method
    
    * update
    
    * Change parameter name
    
    * fix failing tests
    
    * WIP
    
    * Remove todo
    
    There should be some distinction between score after precision filter and actual raw score derived from FuzzySearch. Although so far RawScore is used in testing, but it seems to describe the structure. Originally it was to avoid assigning score directly as it would be hard to reason about that output of FuzzySearch score is.
    
    * Add constructors, remove default to enforce required properties
    
    * remove setting rawscore in SearchPrecision
    
    * Change method name to reflect intention
    
    * Change parameter name + update comment
    
    * update
    
    * Remove params comment

    This test brake was introduced in the following fix:
    
    https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/647/commits/1efe5bff9fcf8216814e12a1045df2668beb1709
    
    It looks to me like the test cases just was also wrong and just wasn't updated with the fix.
    
    I've modified some of the test cases to verify the expected behavior:
    1) Slight refactor of the tests to pass in the SearchReplaceExpected and flags for the tests.
    2) Using Assert::AreEqual instead of Assert::IsTrue for better error meesaging when failed.
    3) Verifying that the behavior is the same with or without match all occurances when using *.
    4) Verifying that without the `UseRegularExpressionsFlag` the `.*` characters get replaced, including when MatchAllOccurances is set.

    directly on score assignment. Score will be "0" if precision filter

    As Alphabet class is static, its methods could be used without

    in an exception.  Therefor only _shouldUsePinyin settings needed will
    be transferred with a given default value.

    FancyZones settings: show proper hotkey even when wrong key was saved before
    
    This makes the Hotkey settings object ignore the key value stored in

    FancyZones: improve windows and apps filtering (#673)
    
    Unifies the way windows are considered "interesting" by FancyZone.
    Berfore the change WinKey + arrows would use different method than
    dragging. This PR makes both use the WinKey + arrows method.
    
    Cleans up FancyZones Settings.cpp by removing m_configStrings variable.
    Contrary to its name it was used to create color picker control.
    
    Adds a multiline option to the text input to settings. Uses this to
    provide the user with a way to exclude certain apps from snapping to
    zones.

    Settings: fix default theme selected option (#571)
    
    The call to load_general_settings will throw an exception if the
    settings.json file for the general settings is not present. This leaves
    settings_theme variable uninitialized, resulting in no value selected in
    the general settings screen for users that did not make any changes to
    the general settings. This fixes this issue by initializing the value
    with a "system" default value.

    don't quit the FZ editor if no layout is selected when clicking on the "Edit selected layout" (#548)
    
    don't exit when clicking on "Apply" if no layout is selected
    
    Credit to @AlexR3 for the fix. Alex provided a more extensive fix that  disable the button when no layout  is selected, but it requires more changes to the XAML and we preferred to avoid that now.

    Added more in-depth check for zone determination when dragging around
    the screen. Previously, it would iterate through the zones in the order
    they were added and find the first one that fit the description. While
    this works in most cases, if a user wants to have overlapping zones, it
    is better to iterate through all of them and find the zone that the user
    expects. There are cases where a zone is completely inaccessible on drag
    because of the current code. To resolve this, the zone search will look
    for the smallest zone possible. The reason I chose this solution is
    because this guarantees that zones are at least reachable since if a
    zone was bigger than another zone, then there must be a part of it
    that is exposed, therefore reachable itself. Note: this solution is for
    the scenario between two zones. More than that is not guaranteed. But I
    feel like this covers enough scenarios to warrant its addition.
    
    Example:
      ----------------
      - Zone1        -
      -  ----------  -
      -  - Zone2  -  -
      -  -        -  -
      -  ----------  -
      ----------------
    
    Previously, zone2 was inaccessible since it would iterate through 1 then
    2. But 1 would always be seen first when dragging a window. With this
    fix it zone2 will be accessible.

    Program paths fix + #1779 (#1780)
    
    * ProgramPaths now searches for files on a per-folder basis using a Queue instead of calling EnumerateFiles.  This allows us to escape permission errors.
    Issue #1779 is fixed because of this too.

    Convert calculator numbers from/to user locale.
    
    Tries to convert numbers in query string to invariant culture format before passing to YAMP, and the other way around when presenting result from
    YAMP. Nothing fancy, just a regular expression scanning for substrings consisting of number, decimal separator and group separator, trying a
    parse and convert on them. Translation is skipped if no conversion between user locale and invariant culture number format is necessary.
    
    Closes #436.
